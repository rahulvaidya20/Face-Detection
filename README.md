Face Detection in C using OpenCV.

Tested on OpenCv version 2.4.9 and 2.4.13.

Most of the code has been commented.

If at all any error occurs, it is most probably due to the haarcascade_frontalface_alt xml file.

Ensure that the xml file is in the same directory as that of the code.

OpenCV 2.4.13's frontalface_alt xml file throws an error, it is better to use older xml files.
